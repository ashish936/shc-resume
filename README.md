# Introduction üëã

A resume is a formal document that gives a summary of your professional experience, accomplishments, and education. It also includes information about any relevant work experience, abilities, or education you may have. A resume allows you to highlight your talents and persuade employers that you are qualified and employable. It is usually accompanied by a cover letter.

# SHC-Resume
This resume is editable. By just clicking on any word within the resume, you may edit it and make your own version.

## How to Use this Application:
In the skills area, you can modify, add, and remove any talent.

Certain sections that may need to be moved can be moved about by dragging and dropping them.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

Next.js was used to construct this project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Start the page editing process by making changes to "pages/index.js." As you alter the file, the page automatically updates.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.


This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

## npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

## npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

## npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can‚Äôt go back!

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
